# Heatmap
Heatmap is basically a graphical visualization of the data.

In the above given cancer data viculaization done in R.It basically shows us the genes which are highly expressed and the genes which are less expressed 

Here as image shown ,the genes showed in red color are highly upregulated genes while blue colored are highly downregulated genes.
Other genes are in range between up and downregulated based on the shade of color.

HISTT2H2AA4,MMP7,DMBT1 are the genes that have highest upregulated gene exression and the KRT13,A2ML1,LOC100132287,CEACAM5 are the genes having downregulated gene expression.
